            I am a software engineer with experience building high-scale and resilient web applications. I specialize in Java-based microservices, but have worked in PHP, Python, and more recently, building single page applications with Javascript, React, and Redux.

            I love learning, building software that's easy for humans to understand, and being part of a team working towards a common goal.
